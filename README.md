The file [README.example.md](https://github.com/spaghetticode/solidus_extensions_management/blob/master/README.example.md)
includes a template for extension README with suggestions and conventions.

[This page](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/wiki/How-to-release-new-versions) has some hints on
releasing a new version of Solidus. Similar conditions should apply for the extensions.
